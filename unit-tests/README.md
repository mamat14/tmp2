# expressivo
simple symbolic system

Expressivo is a lab from "Advanced Software Construction in Java" Edx course. All tests, almost all code, grammar for expressions and parser is written by me.

Briefly it has following functionality:
### > x * x * x
x*x*x

### > !simplify x=2
8

### > !d/dx
(x * x) * 1+(x * 1+1 * x) * x

### > !simplify x=0.5000
.75

### > x * y
x * y

### > !d/dy
0 * y+x * 1

### > - means user input
